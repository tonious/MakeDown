% MakeDown - A Makefile for Pandoc and LaTeX
% Tony Thompson
% 12 June 2009

This Makefile is intended to build largish PDF and HTML documents from
markdown source.  It relies heavily on implicit rules; in most cases
one must only specify dependancies.

This is a non-recursive build system; only one instance of make is needed.
The main advantage of this approach is that dependancy information is
constant throughout the entire tree; this can lead to a substantial reduction
in compile times.  Also, there are fewer spawned processes.  The disadvantage
is that all make instantiations must be done from the root of the tree, i.e.:
from this make file, not from any of the child makefiles.

Requires:

*   LaTeX
*   BibTeX
*   pandoc
*   bibtex2html

Good to have:

*   dot (graphviz)
*   eps2pdf
*   ps2pdf
*   mini-httpd for built in web preview.
